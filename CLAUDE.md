## Rules

1. `/app` is routing only — zero `'use client'`, zero logic, `page.tsx` ≤ 40 lines
2. Interactivity → `<Name>.client.tsx` in `@/components`
3. No `any`, no `as`, no `enum`
4. Semantic tokens only — no hardcoded colors
5. `shadcn/ui` first — before custom primitives
6. Components organized by feature domain — never by type
7. Run `npx prettier --write .` after code changes

## File Placement

1. Page shell → `app/<route>/page.tsx` (≤40 lines, no `'use client'`)
2. API endpoint → `app/api/<resource>/<action>/route.ts`
3. shadcn primitive → `components/ui/`
4. TypeScript type/interface → `lib/types.ts`
5. Component for 1 feature → `components/<feature>/`
6. Component for 2+ features → `components/shared/`
7. Global infrastructure (layout, error, providers) → `components/` root
8. Tunable constant/config → `lib/services/config.ts`
9. Prompt template → `lib/prompts/<descriptive-name>.ts`
10. Service/business logic → `lib/services/`

## Principles

- Simplicity first — smallest change, touch only what's necessary
- No laziness — root causes, no temp fixes, staff engineer standards
- No side effects — changes must not introduce regressions

## Workflow

- Plan mode first for 3+ step tasks. Re-plan if something breaks.
- Use subagents liberally. One task per subagent.
- Never mark complete without verification.

## Lessons

- `page.tsx` is a shell — 40 lines max, composition only, never `'use client'`. Extract all logic into named components.
