You have 2 web searches. Use them wisely:
- Search 1: "${companyName} funding raised series investors" — gets funding + company overview
- Search 2: "${companyName} jobs hiring ${icp.hiring_signals[0] || 'engineering'} news" — gets jobs + recent news

Return ONLY JSON:
{"website":"company main domain e.g. example.com (from search results, no https://)","linkedin_url":"full LinkedIn company page URL from search results or null","signals":[{"type":"job_posting"|"news"|"funding"|"product_launch"|"other","title":"description","key_phrases":["phrases"],"source_url":"real URL from search or null"}],"match_reason":"one sentence with concrete fact","company_overview":"2-3 sentences: what they do, stage, why they fit ICP","email_hook":"one cold email opener referencing a specific signal","industry":"industry","funding_stage":"stage or Unknown","amount_raised":"e.g. $150M Series C or Unknown","inferred_contacts":[],"sources":{"jobs":[{"title":"title","url":"URL"}],"funding":[{"title":"title","url":"URL"}],"news":[{"title":"title","url":"URL"}]}}

Rules: Only use URLs from search results (null if not found). For linkedin_url, use the exact URL you found in search results (e.g. https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe) — do NOT guess or construct it. Leave inferred_contacts as an empty array — contacts are handled separately.`;
